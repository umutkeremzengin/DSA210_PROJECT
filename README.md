# 📊 Step Count vs. Instagram Activity: A Correlation Analysis

## **Motivation**
Physical activity and digital habits are integral parts of modern life, often influencing each other. With the increasing use of social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, understanding how screen time affects daily movement is essential for promoting a balanced lifestyle.

This project explores the relationship between my daily step count and Instagram/TikTok activity. Are they negatively correlated, positively correlated, or unrelated? By analyzing this relationship, I aim to gain insights into how my social media usage impacts my physical activity and vice versa.

## **Data Source**

### 🏋️ **Step Count Data**
- Extracted from the Apple Health app.
- Includes the total number of steps taken each day over a specified period.

### 🔍 **Instagram Activity Data**
- Logged through Instagram’s "Your Activity" feature.
- Provides daily usage time spent on the app.

## **Data Collection Process**

### 📊 **Step Count**
- Synced from my smartphone to the Apple Health app.
- Exported as a `.txt` file for analysis.

### 🔰 **Instagram Activity**
- Accessed via Instagram’s "Your Activity" feature under settings.
- Logged manually into a `.txt` file with daily timestamps.

## **Project Idea**

This project investigates whether there is a correlation between my step count and Instagram activity.

### 🕵️ **Hypothesis**
- Increased Instagram activity might lead to a decrease in physical activity (**negative correlation**).
- Conversely, higher physical activity might reduce Instagram usage.

### 🎯 **Objective**
To identify and interpret any correlation (**positive, negative, or none**) between these two variables and derive meaningful insights based on the findings.

## **Workflow**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Clean and format both datasets (step count and Instagram activity).
- Align datasets by date for consistency.
- Combine the two datasets into a unified structure for analysis.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize step count and Instagram activity trends over time.
- Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
- Identify initial patterns and anomalies.

### **3. Correlation Analysis**
- Use statistical measures (Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation coefficients) to investigate relationships.
- Visualize results through scatter plots and heatmaps.

### **4. Key Findings & Deductions**
- Analyze whether increased Instagram activity correlates with reduced step counts.
- Highlight significant patterns and discuss potential implications.

### **5. Final Report**
- Document results in a comprehensive report.
- Summarize findings, patterns, and implications.
- Provide actionable insights for balancing digital and physical activities.

## **Expected Deliverables**

- 📄 A cleaned and well-structured dataset combining step count and Instagram activity data.
- 🔦 Visualizations and statistical analysis demonstrating any observed relationships.
- 🔒 A final report detailing findings and their implications for lifestyle balance.
