# Step Count vs. Instagram Activity: A Correlation Analysis

# Motivation:

Physical activity and digital habits are integral parts of modern life, often influencing each other. With the increasing use of social media platforms like Instagram, understanding how screen time affects daily movement is important for promoting a balanced lifestyle. This project aims to explore the relationship between my daily step count and Instagram activity. Are they negatively correlated, positively correlated, or unrelated? By analyzing this relationship, I hope to gain insights into how my social media usage impacts my physical activity and vice versa.

# Data Source

Step Count Data: Extracted from the Apple Health app. This data includes the total number of steps I took each day over a specified period.
Instagram Activity Data: Recorded from Instagram's Your Activity feature, which provides insights into the total time spent on the app daily.

# Data Collection Process

Step Count:Synced from my smartphone to the health app.
Exported as a txt file for ease of analysis.

Instagram Activity:Accessed through Instagram's "Your Activity" feature under settings.
Daily usage time waslogged into a txt corresponding to each day's date.,

# Project Idea

This project investigates whether there is a correlation between my step count and Instagram activity:

Hypothesis: Increased Instagram activity might lead to a decrease in physical activity (negative correlation). Conversely, higher physical activity might reduce Instagram usage.

Objective: To identify and interpret any correlation (positive, negative, or none) between these two variables and provide possible deductions based on the findings.

The project begins with data preprocessing, where both datasets—step count and Instagram activity—will be cleaned and formatted to ensure consistency and accuracy. This step includes aligning the datasets by date to facilitate a meaningful analysis. By matching daily step counts with Instagram usage time, I will create a combined dataset ready for exploration.

Following preprocessing, I will conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns within the data. This phase involves visualizing the step count and Instagram activity over time, along with calculating basic statistical measures such as the mean, median, and standard deviation for both variables. These initial insights will set the foundation for deeper analysis.

Once the data is explored, I will perform a correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between step count and Instagram activity. Using statistical measures like Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation coefficients, I will determine the strength and direction of any correlation between these two variables. Visualization techniques such as scatter plots and heatmaps will help illustrate these relationships clearly and intuitively.

The findings from the analysis will be used to derive meaningful deductions. For example, I will explore whether increased Instagram activity correlates with reduced step counts or if no significant relationship exists. These deductions will offer insights into how social media usage might impact physical activity and vice versa, providing a deeper understanding of my own habits.

Finally, the results and conclusions will be documented in a comprehensive report. This report will summarize key findings, highlight notable patterns, and discuss potential implications for maintaining a balanced lifestyle. Where appropriate, I will provide recommendations for improving the interplay between digital and physical activities.



Expected Deliverables: A cleaned and well-structured dataset combining step count and Instagram activity data.
Visualizations and statistical analysis demonstrating any observed relationships.
A final report detailing the findings and their implications.

Notes
This project is based entirely on my personal, historical data.
No assumptions are made for missing or non-existent data; all insights are derived directly from the available records.
